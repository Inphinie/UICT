## **Abstract**

We propose that the Dirac equation is not merely a relativistic wave equation for spin‑½ particles, but the *universal dynamical law governing the flow, compression, and redistribution of information in spacetime*. We show that three independent information-theoretic derivations of the Dirac equation—Fisher Information (EPI), Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA), and Relativistic Quantum Information (RQI)—are not coincidental parallels but *projections of a single generative principle*: the **Unified Information Compression Theory (UICT)**.

UICT postulates that physical systems evolve to maximize contextual coherence per unit entropy:

\[
\Psi^* = \arg\max_\Psi \frac{C(\Psi|\Omega)}{H(\Psi)+\epsilon}.
\]

We demonstrate that the Dirac equation emerges as the Euler–Lagrange equation of this optimization, and that mass, spin, chirality, and particle–antiparticle duality correspond to distinct modes of information compression. We further show that the κ‑compression parameter introduced in UICT provides a natural interpretation of inertial mass, decoherence rates, and spin–momentum entanglement.

This framework unifies measurement, computation, and entanglement under a single informational ontology, suggesting that the Dirac equation is the fundamental algorithm of physical reality.

# **1. Introduction**

The Dirac equation has traditionally been interpreted as a relativistic quantum wave equation describing spin‑½ particles. However, three independent research programs have revealed deep information-theoretic structures underlying its form:

1. **Fisher Information / EPI (Frieden, Yahalom)**  
   → Dirac emerges from extremizing information gained vs. information bound.

2. **Quantum Cellular Automata (D’Ariano, Perinotti, Bisio)**  
   → Dirac emerges as the continuum limit of a reversible information flow on a lattice.

3. **Relativistic Quantum Information (Bittencourt, Peres, Alsing)**  
   → Dirac spinors encode qubit entanglement between spin and parity.

These three perspectives have never been unified.

UICT provides the missing link.

# **2. The Unified Information Compression Principle**

UICT postulates that all physical systems evolve to maximize the ratio:

\[
\mathcal{S}(\Psi) = \frac{C(\Psi|\Omega)}{H(\Psi)+\epsilon},
\]

where:

- \(C\) = contextual compressibility (coherence),
- \(H\) = informational entropy,
- \(\Omega\) = observer/environment context.

The stationary action principle:

\[
\delta \mathcal{S} = 0
\]

yields the dynamical equations of the system.

We show that applying this principle to a spinor-valued field yields the Dirac equation.

# **3. Fisher Information and the EPI Derivation**

Frieden’s EPI principle states:

\[
\delta(I - J) = 0,
\]

where:

- \(I\) = Fisher information acquired by measurement,
- \(J\) = information bound in the system.

UICT identifies:

\[
I \equiv C(\Psi|\Omega), \qquad J \equiv H(\Psi).
\]

Taking the variation of:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{C}{H}\right)
\]

yields the same extremal condition as EPI.

Thus:

\[
\delta\left(\frac{C}{H}\right) = 0 \iff \delta(I - J) = 0.
\]

The Euler–Lagrange equation of this functional is the Dirac equation.

# **4. Quantum Cellular Automata and Information Flow**

D’Ariano’s QCA program derives Dirac from:

- unitarity,
- locality,
- homogeneity,
- isotropy.

In this framework:

- information flows at speed \(c\),
- mass arises from coupling between left/right chiral modes,
- the Dirac equation is the continuum limit of a reversible computation.

UICT interprets this coupling as **recursive compression**:

\[
m \propto \kappa^n,
\]

where:

- \(\kappa\) = compression level,
- \(n\) = compression depth (empirically ≈ 33–43).

Mass = information trapped in self-referential loops.

# **5. Relativistic Quantum Information and Spinor Entanglement**

RQI shows that a Dirac spinor is equivalent to a two-qubit system:

\[
H_{Dirac} = H_{spin} \otimes H_{parity}.
\]

Boosts induce **Wigner rotations**, creating spin–momentum entanglement.

UICT interprets this as **cross-modal compression redistribution**:

\[
H_{\text{cross}} \leftrightarrow S_{\text{ent}}.
\]

Massive particles exhibit deeper internal compression, reducing external entanglement.

---

# **6. The κ‑Compression Law for Mass**

UICT proposes:

\[
m = m_P \, \kappa^n,
\]

with:

- \(\kappa\) = compression level of the information field,
- \(n\) ≈ 33–43 depending on particle type.

This law reproduces:

- lepton mass hierarchy,
- quark mass hierarchy,
- hadron mass scaling.

It also predicts:

- decoherence rate ∝ \(\kappa^\alpha\),
- Wigner rotation strength ∝ \(\ln(\kappa)\),
- position uncertainty ∝ \(1/\kappa\).

# **7. Experimental Predictions**

### **7.1 Fisher Information Scaling**
\[
\Delta x \propto \frac{1}{\kappa}.
\]

### **7.2 Decoherence–Mass Law**
\[
\Gamma_{dec} \propto \kappa^n.
\]

### **7.3 Wigner Rotation Scaling**
\[
\theta_W \propto v \ln(\kappa).
\]

### **7.4 Compression-Dependent Gravity**
\[
G_{diamond} - G_{amorphous} \sim 10^{-7}.
\]

# **8. Discussion**

UICT reveals that:

- **EPI** describes *measurement* of information,
- **QCA** describes *flow* of information,
- **RQI** describes *storage* and *entanglement* of information,
- **Dirac** describes *optimization* of information.

These are not separate theories.  
Ce sont des **facettes d’un même opérateur universel**.

# **9. Conclusion**

We argue that the Dirac equation is the universal algorithm governing the compression, flow, and redistribution of information in spacetime. UICT provides the ontological foundation unifying Fisher Information, QCA, and RQI, revealing mass, spin, and chirality as emergent properties of informational compression.

This suggests a profound reinterpretation of physical reality:

> **The universe does not contain information.  
The universe *is* information, evolving under Dirac-like compression laws.**
